## Project Overview
PURPOSE/SCOPE: <br/>
The purpose of our project is to prove that Netflix is the top streaming service of choice. We will examine Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ datasets to show that Netflix has the highest overall IMDB ratings, variety of genres, number of new releases, number of original shows, variety of MPAA film ratings, growth in subscribers in the last 10 years, and overall value, as the data admits. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-MQRt3X8zItocfS9pvL_s_i0NB57YaRbF6UExKDZGrc/edit?usp=sharing<br/><br/>


## Let's Go to the Analysis
We broke our data down by several different categories. We looked at variety of genres, how much content, what got the best ratings, what was popular with each age group and stock trends. Our hypothesis was that since netflix was the oldest, it would come out first in these categories. In this repository, there are several scripts with these categories broken down to see how we came to our conclusion.
